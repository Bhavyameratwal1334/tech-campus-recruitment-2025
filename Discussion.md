Approach-1
the first approach is to search for linear search on the file completely to find out the logs for a particular day but the problem here is the file size so we use streaming processing to read file line by line.
use the efficient string matching for the logs extraction and then writing the logs in output file.

note: the filepath in the solution should be replaced by the actual file path of the logs file
